          <h4>Jovian Juncture is not only a collection of studio spaces, but
            also a collection of great minds and talent. When decades of our
            combined experience, as well as friendship met, Jovian Juncture was
            born.
            <br /><br />Over the years, we have been able to hone the craft of
            recording, and are now able to help you turn your dream project into
            a realty. Whether you are an individual artist trying to track one
            song, or a band looking to record an album, we want to work with
            you.
            <br />
            <br />
            Community is central to our mission of ratifying the way studios are
            built and book, and how the music is actually created from beginning
            to end.

            <br /><br />

            No longer does a studio with great gear, tons of space and talented
            staff, belong solely, to the artists with unlimited recourses.
            <br />
            <br />

            These spaces are for, by and in our community.
